# hello-world
Just getting started and excited to learn.
Spent seven years working in Education so you know i have a good sense of humor and an appreciation for sitting in the quiet working on a computer.
Earning a master's degree in computer information systems with emphasis in IT Project Management and Cybersecurity.
Hopefully someone hires me someday
